But what does that mean for you?

Whenever I learn something new, I share it here on this blog

### Product Marketing

Product marketing is the process of bringing products to market. 

Through customer research, product selection, product positioning, copywriting and messaging, channel sales enablement, and customer education, Product Marketers are responsible for driving demand and consumption of products.

### Strategy & Tactics

â€œStrategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat." - Sun Tzu

You have to start with Strategy.

* How do you plan to reach new customers?
* How do you decide on which products to focus on?
* How do you plan to engage old customers?

Tactics like Facebook ads and Email campaigns come in later.
