### Why we write
We write about strategy and tactics so that if you are a merchant, you can always keep a pulse on the marketing landscape.
As an added bonus, we use it to reflect on our own product development and marketing efforts.

### Product Marketing
Product marketing is the process understanding both the product and the customers and bridging that gap. Through product selection, channel campaigns, and product positioning, Product Marketers are responsible for driving demand and consumption of the products.

### Strategy & Tactics
â€œStrategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat." - Sun Tzu

You have to start with Strategy.
- How do you plan to reach new customers?
- How do you decide on which products to focus on?
- How do you plan to engage old customers?

Tactics like Facebook ads and Email campaigns come in later.
