# **We are here to "do a job"**

> The framework explains why some people "hire" (buy) products and why certain tradeoffs are made in our customers' mind.

It is worth mentioning that the **phrase** "job-to-be-done" (JTBD) has been carefully worded to reflect that this is about **_perceived progress_** or outcomes in our customers mind. 

The reason why it isn't about "problem-based-selling" is because there are usually both **social and functiona**l dimensions and "problems" doesn't really encapsulate it.

## Jobs are about a "journey"

![](/img/flow.jpeg)

Your product or service doesn't have to cover the whole journey. It has to serve the points along that "journey".

**E.g. Microsoft Word:** One of the most commonly used tools today

* **After** I'm done writing, I have to submit X to my editor, print & update my project mates.
* The next three steps are done on 
  * Email Printer
  * Laser Printer
  * Project management app
* Microsoft did not have to cater to every step

Cater to the first step that you can add "progress" from the status quo.

## Why the buzz?

Before **JTBD**, we'd all thought that the best way to target our audience was through demographics:

```
Middle aged women. 2 kids. Married. Asian
```

What we've all learnt is that NONE of these characteristics actually **cause** me to buy something. They do however, correlate (will come back to this, don't throw this away).

# **JTBD: Context, Annoyance, Trigger & Progress**

* I have always been doing X (context)
* X seems repetitive, annoying, painful (insert annoyance)
* One day Y happens (trigger)
* Search for Progress

If you are a marketer, you might be thinking **"OH! I have to insert myself at Y".**

That's not entirely correct.

Advertisement & marketing campaigns are rarely true triggers.

Think about how many promotions are going on in the world right now. How many products are you buying?

```
There has to be an Annoyance and a Trigger
```

## Competitive Set: Friendship & Beds

Competition only makes sense in the journey towards progress (Job).

When your product surfaces, it could be ONE of the many possible alternatives.

* I have always been **showing up to work late**
* My manager occasionally warns me about **showing up to work late** 
* One day, **my manager said she would fire me if it happened again**
* In search for progress: I could...
  * Get a **louder** **alarm** clock
  * Shift from buses to **personal car**
  * A more **comfortable bed** to get better sleep
  * **Non-products:** A friend to call me, Another job close to home

Competition doesn't make sense without context.\
Competition doesn't begin until the trigger.

# **Fired from the Job**

As illustrated from the previous section, whenever there is a new "hire" there will also be something "fired".

* Soft to loud alarm
* Bus to car
* Bad sleep to good sleep
* Social capital for something else to calling me to wake me up
* Old job to job closer to home


```
This next section is super important
```

To understand how to "design for progress", you have to first understand it.

## Product Design, Copywriting & Sales

There will always be a temptation to tout the 1,000+ features that are vastly superior.

But most of them don't really matter.

Using the example from the previous section, **would a solar-powered, environmentally-friendly, digital clock** matter?

No. Unless it was **louder** than what I already have.

Understanding the "vector-of-progress" is what aids in design and sales.
