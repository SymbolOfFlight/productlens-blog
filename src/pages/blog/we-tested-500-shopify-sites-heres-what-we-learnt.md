# Your own site

If you want to test out your own site, check out

* [Google page speed insight](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/)
* [Ubersuggest](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/)

# Summary of Results

* **Landing** **pages** tend to score about **8% lower** than **product** **pages** 
  * Mostly because of pop-ups
* **Mobile** tends to score **59% lowe**r than **Desktop**. 
  * Lots of merchants ignore their mobile experiences)
* The **average** site ranks for about **552 keywords.**
* The **median** site ranks for about **302 keywords.**
* The **average** **backlinks** per store might be in the **thousands** (24,222). 
  * **Note:** Lots of the backlinks come from a similar site & having backlinks from the same site doesn't have the same SEO juice 
* The **median** backlinks per store is only about **8**. 
  * So, there’s loads of space for improvement here.

# Disclaimers. Test Parameters.

We understand that 500 stores is only about 0.05% of the 1,000,000 Shopify stores out there.

To make the results more achievable, we took stores that ranked between 150,00 to 300,00 (So the 15-30% percentile) in terms of Alexa rank.

For backlinks, "No Follow" links were ignored for this study

We ran them against free tools: Google PageSpeed Insights + Ubersuggest

Both great tools to get you started on your SEO journey.

# Further Findings

We found the general rankings of these 500 sites (according to Alexa) and we ran the numbers to check which factors correlated to their Alexa ranking.

The top three were

* Mobile Load Speed of Product pages
* Organic Keywords
* Number of backlinks

**Note:** We know there could be a hundred other factors (e.g. We don’t know how much these sites pay for their traffic)

# Key Takeaways

## Mobile Experience

Working on mobile experience for both your landing pages and product pages is no longer a "good-to-have".

Takeways:

1. **Set some plugins to only work on desktop** so they don’t slow down the experience
2. Work on your **product page scores first** because that where you will be running ads to
3. Monitor the **keywords** for your product pages because those will help you rank

## Keywords

Ranking for keywords is really hard. You have to think of this as a long-term strategy.

> Google tends to rank sites for multiple keywords. 

The median is 302 keywords so it will take you quite a while to get there.



## Backlinks

Backlinks are much easier to build. 

> If you had at least 10 backlinks from relevant sites, you would be way ahead of the pack.

If you have been doing content for a while, I would spend 80% of my time working on building backlinks.
