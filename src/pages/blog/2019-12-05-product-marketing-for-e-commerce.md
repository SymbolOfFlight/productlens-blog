To ensure the overall success, this includes, customer research, assortment planning, product positioning, copywriting and messaging, channel sales enablement and customer education.

# **Atoms & Bits**

Most of the thought leaders in the product marketing space comes from companies like [Drift](https://www.drift.com/), [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/) and [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/), all great companies, but their content skews very much towards Software-as-a-service (SaaS) businesses.

## **Why is Product Marketing for E-commerce so different?**

As a brand or retailer, two major differences

1. Customer research
2. Product development

**Customer Research**\
1-to-1 Customer research methods that take 1 hour each just doesn’t scale for you.

**Product Development**\
Retailers have the advantage when it comes to “product development”.\
\
You don’t have to manufacture most of your products in-house. \
\
After customer research, you can build a really successful business by piecing together the best products from everywhere (Think [Sephora](https://www.sephora.com/)).



# **Roles & Responsibilities**

**Product Marketers** are focused on bridging the gap between products and customers. \
This means driving demand and usage of products.

# **Steps**

## 1. Customer Research

Take your time to learn from your customers. 

* Form a Hypothesis
* Speak to about 20 customers
  * 10 who have already bought from you, 10 who have not
* Look for further evidence

Once you are at the "**Looking for evidence**" phase, you can try [Facebook Audience Insights](https://www.facebook.com/ads/audience-insights/) (under Business Manager). Look for groups, interest, behaviour that support/ disprove your original hypothesis.

## 2. Assortment Planning

This can take the form of either **product design** or **sourcing** (or both).

Based on customer research, look for or design products that fulfil those checkbox.

## 3. Product Positioning

Back to the notes that you took during the customer research phase, you must have noticed certain words used to describe different issues they faced.

> Position your product in such a way that they can understand the value proposition.

Example of an Alarm clock

## 4. Copywriting & Messaging

Leveraging what you’ve already prepared in the positioning phase, match the copywriting and messaging to the channels.

* Hashtags on Twitter
* Keywords for Search

## 5. Channel Sales Enablement

This step involves doing what is necessary to enable the success of a particular sales channel.

Based on the initial promise in the positioning, deliver relevant content

* For the offline world, this tends to be training & onboarding of sales reps.
* For Instagram, this could mean relevant Hashtags + multiple photos.
* For your online store, this means showing customers relevant content.

## 6. Customer Education

Your customers (or potential customers) aren't always in the same phase.

Only a small minority know both the problem and the solution. Most, either haven't thought of the solution or they don't even realise the problem.

You have to tweak your messages accordingly
